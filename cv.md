I'm using English since school, I was played a lot of quest games. Later I got my first speaking experience during commissioning of Tinkoff Brew plant. Since then I was working a lot with foreigin specialists at all my jobs. I like to practice my English, cause I feel how it evolve. I think that the best way to learn anything leads thru practics.
